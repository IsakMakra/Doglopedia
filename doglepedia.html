            <p> Chewbacca, also known as Chewie, was a warrior, smuggler, and resistance fighter who fought in many wars in his life. He was from the world of Kashyyyk and became a military leader, having participated in the Clone Wars as an ally to the Jedi. In the years following the birth of theGalactic Empire, he would be condemned to slavery. After Chewbacca was freed by Han Solo, he     swore a life-debt to him and joined Solo throughout his smuggling career, becoming his co-pilot on         
                
            the Millennium Falcon. In the days after the theft of the Death Star plans, both he and Solo fell in with the Rebel Alliance and participated at the Battle of Yavin, aiding Luke Skywalker in destroying the Death Star. After the battle, he was considered a rebel hero, and he would throughout the war play a role in key victories against the Empire alongside Solo and their new friends Luke and Leia, and droids C-3PO and R2-D2. </p>
